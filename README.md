# Runner

Runner provides a easy-to-use platform for efficient valet ticket management.

## Technologies

I wrote the app in [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) using the [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) framework to develop the UI.  [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) takes care of user authentication and database management through [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) and [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore).

## Roadmap

* Allow one user to create separate collections of tickets for different locations
* Share ticket collections between users
* Clean up UI
* Publish to App Store
